# minifarm-api
APIs for minifarm v0.1
## Prepare
* Install serverless

  ```
* Install PostgreSQL database in your local or use PostgreSQL RDS on aws
* Run script on setup.sql to create a database
* Run script on setup.sql to enable uuid on the database

## TODO
* required node_modules cannot be copied automatically to .webpack and packaged into serverless zip
* find a way to optimize serverless package size and packaing policy
* api doc/swagger and validator
* automatically deploy api gateway
* massivejs monitoring queries doens't work: https://massivejs.org/docs/connecting
* how to debug serverless offline
* check if the db is one in the server environment - also how to avoid the warnings in local with sls offline
* how to make jest unit test work with serverless offline
* add config for stage and prod

## Stack
* serverless framework + aws
* koa for rest api (router, logger, error handling)
* jest for unit testing
* superagent as HTTP client (axios )
* introduce multiple routers for modularity
* run on debug mode
* use koa-body to support multipart, urlencoded and json request bodies
* use boom for HTTP-friendly error objects
* eslint with standard for code qualities ([![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com))
* prettier for code formatter 
* [serverless-webpack](https://github.com/serverless-heaven/serverless-webpack) to bundle lambda with webpack
  * build to dist foler: sls webpack
  * package to .serverless folder (zip): ```sls package```
  * run offline: ```sls offline```(the default "Watching for changes" doesn't work well)
  * deploy to aws: ```sls deploy```
* use babel to add support to ES6/ES7 javascript
* introduce massivejs for postgres database access (may try Objection + Knex in the future)
* introduce ajv for json schema validation (joi is a good choice as well but it's not serializable; schm is another good choice, but it's not follow a spec, has limitted features, and not that popular)
* use koa-combine-routers to combine routes so the kao app simply adds the combined routes
* make massive-js work with aws lambda (NOTE: postgres on aws should allow lambda access by using VPC/database security group)
* use serverless variables to load different configurations based on stage: local, dev, staging, or production.
* use AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store to store encrypted parameters
* use serverless-jest-plugin to use jest with serverless framework for unit testing
  ```
  sls invoke test [--stage stage] [--region region] [-f function]
  ```
* TODO: coputed columns (e.g. full name), full text search, data schema and validation, DTO valication
* TODO: complete postman test scripts
* TODO: sqitch for database management


NOTE:

In order to update serverless globally to avoid "serverless update check failed" error, run the following commands:
```
npm install -g try-thread-sleep
npm install -g serverless --ignore-scripts spawn-sync
```
